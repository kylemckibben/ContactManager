## Summary
I wanted to learn Django REST Framework (DRF), but not just follow the tutorial directly, instead creating my own project with a little extra depth. A contact manager seemed appropriate for implementing the CRUD operations without too much extra complexity. I additionally opted to develop my views using TDD, use PostgreSQL for my database, and build a React front end on top of the API.
